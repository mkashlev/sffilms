Using SFGov API.

This should display all filming locations for that movie on the map.
This should also display list of locations on the right
Clicking on any location on the right will highlight it on the map.

Code was done in python. I picked Python/Django as I am familiar with it from my work at Coffee Meets Bagel. However, I never set up the system at CMB, so I spent quite a lot of time setting up django on my heroku instance.

I am experienced in Javascript and jQuery, so this was the framework of my choice as a result.
